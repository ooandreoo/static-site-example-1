## TO-DO list for the day

### What is it?

Do you want to keep track of the things you have are doing, have done and need to do during
the day?

Well, this simple website might give you a hand.

Also, you get to download the tasks and their tag in a csv file so that you can upload it
the next day you want to use this tool

### Terminology

- Task: any event, task, or activity that you want to keep track of
- Tag: a state that you want to label activities with. Example, an activity "drive to school"
can have the tag "To-Do" before it's done, and can have the "Done" tag after the activity is
completed.

### Why do I need this?

You don't ... unless you do ;)
