<h2>Basics</h2>
<p>
  Within a football team there is one single player whose actions define the
  result of the game, because strikers can miss lots of possible goals, score
  at the very last minute and they would have done their job. However, a
  goalkeeper has to give its maximum effort not to miss a single ball, because
  a miss means a goal for the other team (unless the oponent striker misses).
</p>
<p>
  There is no need to get anxious though, nobody is expecting top class
  performances unless you are at first division league (and even there you can
  see some bloopers once in a while). It is important to have this in mind
  because as a not professional goalkeeper you need to build confidence first
  of all, because almost every action a goalkeeper executes requires
  a good amount of confidence in your own capabilities and skills.
</p>
<p>
  As a goalkeeping fan and having been a goalkeeper myself during my childhood
  and part of my youth, I identified later in my life which are some of the
  basic skills and capabilites that everyone trying to become a better
  goalkeeper should give some training time to.
  The physical capabilities are:
  <ul>
    <li>Flexibility</li>
    <li>Good reflexes</li>
    <li>Physical Strength</li>
    <li>Explossiveness</li>
  </ul>
  The soft skills to consider are:
  <ul>
    <li>Self confidence</li>
    <li>Be able to communicate with defenders</li>
    <li>Resillience</li>
    <li>It is just a game mentality</li>
  </ul>
  The goalkeeping skills you need to focus are:
  <ul>
    <li>Scoop</li>
    <li>Cup</li>
    <li>W</li>
    <li>Diving W</li>
  </ul>

<h2>Equipment</h2>
<p>
  The basic equipment you need is a pair of gloves, doesn't matter if they
  are not fancy to start. You only need a little bit of the grappling
  advantage of the glove and it makes it a bit easier to punch the ball.
</p>
<p>
  If you are training on sintetic field, you probably would wanna wear
  long sleeve shirts and goalkeeper pants, or long socks, because your
  falling technique won't be as polished yet at the beginning, so be
  prepared to get a bit hurt.

<h2>Training Tips</h2>
<p>
  Goalkeeper training should be different than the average player in some
  specific ways, like more explosiveness in the legs because usually
  goalkeepers need to be really fast within their area to shorten the distance
  between them and the ball before the attackers strike.
</p>
<p>
  Following with the legs, another thing to consider training is the jump. To
  the side, to the top, low range, wide range, you better train this variations
  of jumps because they will be part of your routine as a goalkeeper while at 
  the game. I would emphasize to train this specific type of jump:
  <ol>
    <li>
      another team player send a high ball to the area (from the corner or 
      any other place on the field)
    </li>
    <li>
      another team players act as attackers kind of difficulting your mobility
      and or visibility in the area (you can use sticks or something similar
      instead of people for the obstacles)
    </li>
    <li>
      train your mobility while watching the ball and match it with a good 
      jump to catch or punch the ball while it is still high enough so that no
      attacker can hit it with their heads
    </li>
  </ol>

  That specific exercise is a true gem of a train, because many goalkeepers focus on doing great
  saves from long shoots directly to the goal, but few know how to intercept a high ball going into
  their area.
</p>
<p>
  Other type of explosiveness that goalkeepers need to train is the one involving arms and core.
  These ones are important because different to the rest of the players, goalkeepers sometimes end
  up laying on the floor and they need to recover from that position to be ready to receive another
  strike or to start a counter attack. So pushups and working out your core is a must as part of
  your training as a goalkeeper.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, always train with the team players that will act as barrier on the free kicks. Always
  talk to one of them to help you set the barrier, so that this player moves the barrier to the
  left or the right according to your preference. You need to stick to the side of the goal and
  the barrier should obstruct a direct shot from the ball position, so move it until you can no
  longer see the ball, and then go to the other side of the goal and wait.
